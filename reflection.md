**Challenges**:
I tried using the online link for Tailwind CSS libraries, but it didn't work no matter what I tried so I downloaded a local instance of it to try and run it. However, I had insane issues trying to get it to format the way I wanted it to. I tried searching using Google and ChatGPT why it wasn't working, but got pretty much nothing successful.


**Responsiveness/Design Choices**:
For responsiveness I used media queries through a separate CSS file so that it could apply to all the different files I have. For design, I was thinking an early 2000s team going along with the Spongebob theme, but unfortunately I could barely get it to work in time for the due date of this assignment. I'll definitely keep tinkering though.
